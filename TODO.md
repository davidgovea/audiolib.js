## General thoughts
 * Resampling.. NaN length Float32 array creation

 * Biquad documentation is borked (bitcrusher remnants)

 * Decay param for tracker note overflows
 
 * BufferEffectChain?? wrapper-end line 110

 * Implement freeverb comb filter & all-pass (not biquad APF)

 * Implement [freeverb](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html)
 
 * Implement proper dynamic range compressor


## To do when bored
 * Investigate MIDI sequencer

 * Investigate audio workers

 * Play with sampler
